title: "Diffusion representation for asymmetric kernels via magnetic transform"
collection: publications
category: accept
excerpt: 'This method maps an asymmetric kernel to the complex-valued field, embedding the symmetric and
skew-symmetric parts to module and phase respectively, which enables a new dimension reduction method for data endowed with an asymmetric similarity 
such as directed graphs and trophic networks.'
