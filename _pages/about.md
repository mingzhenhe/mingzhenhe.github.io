**About Me**
------
Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Image Processing Pattern Recognition in the Department of Automation, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin). Before, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Automation, at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

Feel free to drop me an email to connect!

**Research Interests**

My research interest starts from investigating asymmetric kernels, the primal-dual relationship, and random features. 
Currently, my research focuses on the following directions:
- Machine learning theory: potential function space for asymmetric kernels.
- Applications: Graph Neural Networks and Transformers understood by asymmetric kernels.
